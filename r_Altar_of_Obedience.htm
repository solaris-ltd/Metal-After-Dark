				Malicious</a></h3>
	<p class="text-base">Swedish-based death metal band Altar of Obedience commandeer violence and pure aggression in
		debut album 'Malicious'. Despite the brief twenty-five minute runtime, Altar of Obedience pound out wave after wave
		of auditory assault with diverse solos, tempos and kick-ass riffing. Fused with pained rasping vocals, the
		instruments are used like weapons and never once take a moment to drop below par. An odd use of sampling features on
		a few tracks to add a bit of questionable spice to the mix. What the album does deliver on every track, however, is
		a quintessential metal ingredient: Fast uniqely blended solos. Never for a moment does this album lose focus or pace
		and remains strong to death metal roots.</p>
	<p class="text-base">What sticks out most to me across this album are the guitar solos. Present throughout every
		track, often multiple times, the band pierces the air with shrill rapid playing. However, a unique almost
		off-sounding guitar tone is used throughout certain sections of a solo which I found to be the most creative and
		memorable component of the album. It almost adds a hint of gothic to the blaring atmosphere without ever turning
		slow and gloomy. This fusion is done exceptionally well and is what kept me engaged from the start. The speed is
		never once dropped throughout these vibrant solos, really reflecting the band's talent in their skilled
		experimentation.</p>
	<p class="text-base">An area which perhaps cannot be so praised is the occasional samples used throughout the album. I
		am generally one to enjoy samples at the start or end of a track (provided they aren't overdone), but of the few
		used here, they leave me confused. Most notably, on the track 'Church of Deceit', torward the end of the song a
		bizzare sample is inserted quite abruptly that in complete honesty just sounds like a robot taking a shit. I can't
		tell what it's supposed to be, or what purpose it serves. It took my focus of the rest of the fantastic sound
		because thus far, 'Church of deceit' had a running shot at my favourite track. Nevertheless, the sample isn't too
		overdone and considering it is in the last thirty seconds, has only a minor impact. Used to a far better effect
		would be the rain sample and distorted vocals on the track 'They come at night'. Distorted vocals create a
		chillingly haunting effect on any song and, particularly on this track, the effect is heightened by it being
		predominantly instrumental creating an almost death metal meets horror movie mix.</p>
	<p class="text-base">Altar of Obedience display their complete control of the two ultimate speeds: fast and slow. Most
		tracks will start and end like a punch to the gut, but balance this assault with slower, grudgier sections. These
		sections are supported by strong, steady double kicks and an indisputably brutal bass. Yet the tables could turn at
		any section and kick the speed into overdrive. These unexpected twists and turns create for an engaging listen. It
		goes without saying the riffs are written to be catchy and will have you headbanging hard even if you wanted to
		resist.</p>
	<p class="text-base">Unquestionably, the main area this album suffers is the runtime. It really is over far before I
		expected as haunting screams fade out on the final track 'Paradise of burning flesh' and I found myself craving
		more. Despite the mere twenty-five minutes, Altar of Obedience leave no room for rest as they punish, pound and
		assault from every angle on the appropriately-titled 'Malicious'. Swedeath at its finest, this album truly has my
		ears widely peeled for the next release.</p>

				of Horror</a></h3>
	<p class="text-base">The volume of this album speaks measures to the passion exercised by Anaal Nathrakh in this pounding 33-minute
		album. Having not explored this band much prior to listening, I didn’t know what to expect, but I kept my ears open.
		Albeit, at first I didn’t know what to make of such extremities in almost all aspects but I’m now confidently
		enjoying spinning ‘A New Kind of Horror’ on a rainy Friday evening.</p>
	<p class="text-base">I can’t recall ever hearing such a bizarre combination of vocal styles in such an extreme album, yet oddly enough
		it… works? From the high-pitched mic-in-throat screaming to coarse disgruntled growls and unexpectedly King
		Diamond/Mercyful Fate style falsetto. Even some powerful deep operatic vocals set the tone of war placing you in a
		death-filled trench while gunfire rages around. Hearing this variety across the tracks was all in all quite well
		done in creating a unique flavour to each track. It especially pairs in well when the occasional symphonic
		background instruments would appear forming some kind of “melodic-slam” hybrid which may not be everyone’s pill to
		swallow. Alas, there are but a few moments where falsetto is used despite it building the exciting rush you might
		get from listening to traditional metal vocalists belting almighty battle anthems, yet also working on a deeper
		level with a sense of distressed sentiment. These sentimental moments serve as a perfect metaphor for the few quiet
		seconds in war before all hell breaks loose and everything is simply drowned out by the sounds of violence.</p>
	<p class="text-base">Aiding to the evident themes of war presented are the industrial sound effects and ambience present in most tracks.
		Most serve no further purpose than to warp or emphasise a particular sound or moment. However, my favourite track,
		“Foward!” uses the sound of a shotgun firing and reloading as part of the main riff to the chorus which is
		admittedly catchy as hell. That’s about the most I can say for these digitalised industrial elements as I don’t
		particularly see a purpose or enjoyment of them in most cases.</p>
	<p class="text-base">This album feels a bit cramped with its mere 33-minute runtime. Granted, this is a hypocritical judgement for a
		band with roots in grindcore. Even so, expanding on some of the musical ideas explored on the tracks would have yes,
		created a longer and perhaps more tedious listen but would undoubtedly bring something new to the table. In saying
		this, what it does manage to achieve in the timespan is nothing short of ruthless and metal.</p>
	<p class="text-base">For such a short playtime, Anaal Nathrakh demonstrates the creative fuel by the use of the unconventional elements
		often seen in crossover styles. Each track ties seamlessly in with one another while still, each offers a unique
		element. It’s an exciting, hammering listen that still has plenty to offer for a quick noise slam to the brain.</p>

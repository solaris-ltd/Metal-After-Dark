				Dathomir</a></h3>
		<p class="text-base">Anatomy's 1999 album 'The Witches of Dathomir' presents what I have found to be a sinisterly
			delightful blackened death sound. Blending anguished black metal instrumentals with powerful death metal screams,
			snarls and growls truly is what gives this album its unique flavour. The band also weaves acoustic or melodic
			sections in and out of the album at perfect points while never faltering from their death and black roots. Some
			tracks' sections are transformed seamlessly from black metal to a rock-esque-style rhythm and then back again in a
			pleasant manner that never disrupts the flow of a song. Its this level of variety that sets the record apart from
			the average run-of-the-mill death or black metal production.</p>
		<p class="text-base">Listening to the 2016 re-release provides an incredibly rich sound quality. Every note is sharp
			as steel, every drum beat is crisp; yet none of the metal sound has been sacrificed for this quality. Production
			of
			this quality really adds to the haunting atmosphere overshadowing the album. The sinister opening track 'Ambrosia
			Death' fades in with a gentle acoustic intro that, while pleasant sounding to begin with, descends in and out of a
			dark-sounding melody almost as a musical warning for the next forty minutes the record presents. A feature of this
			album I quite enjoyed was these acoustic moments, sporadically placed among a few of the tracks, most notably on
			the
			bridge of 'Cauldron Nebular'. This strategic placement was a creative way to add variety a little over halfway
			into
			listening. Let's be honest, albums that are nothing but aggressive do need moments in between to emphasise moments
			and keep ears engaged. Thankfully, it isn't overdone either as while maintaining a slow swinging pace, the band
			ramps up the dreary tone in utter despair in a chilling manner. A few more of these acoustic moments, or even an
			entire track, might have added some more variation, but granted; this is black metal. Besides, that really is why
			melodic subgenres exist anyway.</p>
		<p class="text-base">The blackened death mix is married perfectly by the vocals and the instruments. Tuned and toned
			to black metal perfection, the guitars are ruthless in their speed and menacing in their slower moments. The drums
			never stop, pushing out faster and faster blast beats, or a steadily-paced swing beat supported by constant double
			kicks working in perfect synchronicity. The vocals are undoubtedly rooted in death metal with deep throaty snarls
			and growls delivering every line with sheer volume. This obvious fusion of genres fits together perfectly. It
			creates an engaging sound that will keep anyone hooked right down to the last ear-splitting moment and I have to
			applaud the band for executing this so perfectly. As someone who has tried time and again to get into black metal,
			its records like this that give me hope.</p>
		<p class="text-base">There are many moments as I've mentioned where the speed and rhythm can change with little to
			no
			warning while still remaining to be a seamless transition. Having a track broken up into swing sections is a real
			treat for me in metal, especially in such an unexpected genre. This particularly stuck out to me on the track 'Far
			From the World of Blue'. The track starts with a rock and roll-sounding rhythm with the exception of a steady
			backing double kick. Being one of the longest tracks on the album, I had expectations for it. Those expectations
			were met in ways I couldn't have expected and I would confidently say it was my favourite track of the album.</p>
		<p class="text-base">While the band expertly crafts variety into the instrumentation, they only give small taste
			tests
			of other elements which I would have loved to see more of. For example, the brief amount of synth on 'Blood will
			follow thee' was unpredictable, yet I wanted to hear it return at a later point. Sadly, my wish was never met and
			I
			will forever be trying to repair the hole in my heart. On the vocal side of things, a single line is screamed in
			an
			unorthodox power metal-style on 'Suncrusher', another minor element which was done artistically and could
			certainly
			have been used a few more times. It almost feels like the band played around with these elements, but was too
			afraid
			to fully commit to using them. Of course, it doesn't take away from the glorious sound thus far produced, but
			certainly could have added much more to it.</p>
		<p class="text-base">'The Witches of Dathomir' is a brutal blackened death record that maintains violence and
			variety.
			Its unique experimentation of minor elements and sounds creates many memorable moments, even if they weren't later
			expanded upon. Anatomy has built this upon the roots of black metal and death metal and pulverises, terrifies and
			bleeds at every corner and turn. I would certainly recommend this album to any death metal fan ready to explore
			the
			dark and cold realm that is black metal.</p>

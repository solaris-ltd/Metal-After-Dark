				Inferno</a></h3>
	<p class="text-base">‘Embrace the Inferno’ seemed like a promising groove/thrash album at first and it’s always fun discovering a niche
		little album as such all the way back from 2009. Certainly the first few tracks seemed promising enough and the band
		seemed to bring their energy. But upon further and further listening to the album, Embrace the Inferno revealed more
		and more of its blandness right until the final title track to which my reaction simply was “well that happened”.
		Maybe this would have been more tolerable if it had been a thirty to forty minute album, or even just as an EP, but
		this is an hour of my life I’ll never get back.</p>
	<p class="text-base">The first thirty seconds are really the only enjoyable moments for me. Opening with ‘The Darkest Hour’ I was lulled
		into a false sense of believing this would be an absolutely pulverising thrash album reminiscent of bands like
		Testament and Slayer. Beyond Agony also does some really nice melodic riffs throughout the verses of The Darkest
		Hour and I wasn’t complaining (at first). The instrumentation had a razor-sharp sound and tone to it which paired
		with the production, was sublime to listen to. The vocals screams were a bit soft and never really felt as harsh as
		they could be. At a few moments I could even hear the singer’s voice crack and slip into his regular voice for a
		split second. Nonetheless, I could look past this for the first track (admittedly a pretty damn good song and my
		favourite on the record) and possibly the next two or three. But that’s about all I have to say for the album. From
		there it quickly became unexciting.</p>
	<p class="text-base">It becomes very obvious that Beyond Agony have a tried and tested formula for writing songs as if they were
		factory-manufactured. For the shorter tracks, there would just be a very plain, stereotypical hard rock riff with a
		quick solo before switching to a half-time breakdown following the bridge. It’s a shame, the solos were played like
		lightning but they became redundant when they were just there to fill the atmosphere. The same could be said about
		the breakdowns. There was not a single track that did not feature a breakdown. If there’s one thing that annoys me,
		its obnoxious deathcore breakdowns. If there’s one thing that straight up pisses me off, it’s metal albums that make
		me feel like I’m listening to deathcore. If any of these breakdowns had been the only one or two to feature on the
		album, they would have enhanced that track and given it something unique. But no, they were copied and pasted across
		to every track, sucking out any trace of individuality each song might have possessed. </p>
	<p class="text-base">Some of the longer tracks that clocked in around the seven to eight minute mark followed this same formula but
		would just slap on a random melodic or acoustic sequence before the breakdown. The only variety this really created
		was that instead of the album being all the same songs, it was all the same songs except long and short versions. I
		didn’t enjoy them and if these longer tracks weren’t there or were at least cut shorter the album might have been
		saved by a shorter runtime. Alas, every listener is subjected to the full hour. </p>
	<p class="text-base">If I had heard any of the tracks released as a single, I probably would have them on full blast because on their
		own, they do create a nice hard rock/groove metal blend. But hearing eleven tracks that are essentially the same has
		done my head in. Thank fuck for the opener The Darkest Hour because in fairness it is the most thrashy and the most
		unique. I would’ve loved a memorable groove metal album but this just isn’t it. Well, that album happened I guess.

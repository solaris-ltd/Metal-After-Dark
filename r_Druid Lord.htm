				the
				Dead</a></h3>
		<p class="text-base">It’s far too early in the year to start forming a ‘best albums of 2022’ list but one month into
			the year (at the
			time of release), ‘Relics of the Dead’ has secured a spot as a tough contender. Knowing this was a death-doom
			release by a band called ‘Druid Lord’, I had expectations. Those expectations were met and exceeded in this album.
			There are only two speeds on this release - drearily slow and excitingly fast. These two speeds are well balanced
			out by the band, never giving you too much or too little of either which proves to be an effective formula the
			further I listened.</p>
		<p class="text-base">The production and instrumentation have elaborately crafted a murky, oozy atmosphere of horror
			pairing in
			perfectly
			with such terrifying track listings as “Thirteen Days of Death”, “Immolated Into Ashes” and my personal favourite,
			“Festering Tombs”. The depth of the sound executes perfect bulldozer-esque riffing backed by steady drumming. With
			most tracks reaching the 6-7 minute mark, it left plenty of time for Druid Lord to execute fast blast beats,
			sometimes at a fast tempo, sometimes still maintaining a slow rhythm decorated by skillful guitar solos. These
			time
			changes would sometimes be broken up by a single isolated riff or would evolve from a gradually building tempo
			that
			created some exciting tension. The graduality factor wins me over every time I listen to this masterpiece and the
			way it’s cleverly used is what undeniably sets this album apart as its own.</p>
		<p class="text-base">It seems to be after the interval track, “Nightside Conjuring” (which includes a horror sample
			and albeit, is my
			least favourite point during the listen as it seems to serve no real purpose) that the band focuses more on their
			slow side. Speed of course is present but it does take on a more sombre tone post the halfway point. This didn’t
			overly affect my enjoyment to any degree but does create some obvious division in album structure. The track
			titles
			almost pertain to this aesthetically. Whether this was, in fact, intentional or not, it’s regardless a creative
			stylistic device.</p>
		<p class="text-base">Slow or fast, ‘Relics of the Dead’ lays gravestones into the brains of anyone to immerse
			themselves within its
			gloomy punishing tracks. The design and layout construct a desolate atmosphere powered by its doomy horror. If
			this
			is how 2022 starts in terms of releases, we’re unquestionably looking at a very promising year for auditory
			enjoyment.</p>

<h1><i>Cold Thrower -  75%</i></h1>
<h3><b><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7ewHeLLc0bjU6ImzgBLUpj?si=1cd3ca80c0c94fe5">Frozen Soul - Crypt of Ice</b></a></h3>

<p>The first band mentioned when clear inspirations for Frozen Soul are listed is always the same: Bolt Thrower, Bolt Thrower and... You guessed it! Bolt Thrower. One of the most legendary bands in death metal. This comparison is of course completely justified. Frozen Soul have done absolutely everything Bolt Thrower-style. Is this the worst rip-off ever? No. Is it the greatest "Bolt Thrower cool!" shout ever? No. In and of itself, the album at a first listen is brilliant. The theme of ice and the shivering arctic cold creates a really cool (pun intended) atmosphere that adds to the overall listening experience. It almost creates some kind of bizarre psychological effect of physical feeling chilly, but maybe that's just me really immersing myself in this album on a cold winter's night. I don’t usually enjoy random sounds during album interludes, intros or outros, but to a small extent they create some variety on top of the repetitive nature of the songs. This is probably where the main criticism of the album comes in: There is little to no variety between tracks. The tone is pretty constant, backed by the same double-kick beat on most of the songs. Even just throwing in a fill here and there would have been something as the double kicks start to become almost a drone in my brain the more and more I listen to this album.</p>
<p>The opening title track, “Crypt Of Ice” shows some promise, starting off with pounding drums and aggressive riffing which grabbed my attention instantly the first time I listened to the album, and it still does everytime I put it on. This track also slows down at a few points which emphasise the extreme Bolt Thrower-esque vocals. Sadly, this songs ends a bit too prematurely as it leads into “Arctic Stranglehold”, a song that is one of the most generic songs on the album that just seems to go on and on in a loop without end. The driving riff of the song has nothing special to it, as do the bass and drums. The band occasionally, as I mentioned, throw in some random sound effects at the start of some of the songs to distract the listener from the supposedly ‘new’ riff that they’ve been hearing the whole time. Undoubtedly, the sound itself on its own is chilling, haunting and most of all, heavy; but no matter how well a single song is written, you simply just cannot reuse that same formula and vary it in little ways by slowing it down at a point different to the previous song, or playing a different cymbal or… well you get the idea.
</p>
<p>I’ve held off from mentioning the vocals so far, but they are a distinct aspect of this album. I’ll preface this by saying, I do like the vocal style but again, Bolt Thrower. These vocals are impressive in their own regard; the deep guttural growls hit the nail on the head for Crypt Of Ice but some originality to the style would really make this album its own. Instead of taking me into the Bolt Thrower arctic blizzard, I want to be taken to the Frozen Soul arctic blizzard. There’s little variety in tone and pitch which would have created contrast and distinction to really create a narrative of the freezing winter. 
The atmosphere that has been created is probably the strongest point of this album. Coming from a band named Frozen Soul, they’ve at least put effort into atmosphere. Prior to listening to this, I probably would have laughed if I’d heard any instrument being described as freezing. But that is the best word I can think to use when describing any element of this album, whether individual or together. The deep growling vocals and bass build the walls of a cave filled with the icy taste of the snarling guitars and clean but merciless drums. The atmosphere probably carries the weight of the whole album, being its critical saving trait, but is unfortunately not enough to distract from the formula evident on most of the songs.
</p>
<p>There is potential on this album, I’m sure as the band matures, they will crawl out of their Bolt Thrower shell and emerge into the Frozen Soul wasteland, brandishing their style like a blood-stained icicle. I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt, because after all, this is their first album and Frozen Soul have a whole career ahead of them. By no means do I hate the album - I still enjoy a few of the songs from time to time, though I’d rather be listening to Bolt Thrower. No other album has ever chilled me this much and for that I applaud them. But please, for the love of death metal, have some variety. At the very least realise that fast double kick doesn’t always automatically equal death metal. This ‘cold school’ death metal regardless still has me eager for another album. Please don’t release it in summer though.</p>

<p>It’s been about a month now since the release of Glacial Domination and I can say with confidence its a huge improvement since Crypt of Ice. Glacial Domination sees the band experimenting with new ideas, features and guest appearances while still maintaining a kick-ass self-described cold-school death metal style. Being one of my personal favourite bands, I’ve kept this album on repeat since its release and regret to only just now be reviewing it. But better late then never right?</p>
<p>A lot of the issues I had with Crypt of Ice have resolved themselves on Glacial Domination. To start with - variety. It doesn’t feel like every single track has been copied and pasted. Each track is a unique song with its own chilling twists and turns. The band hasn’t completely changed their style either, however, chugging out mighty riff after riff. Even on Crypt of Ice, the riffs were motherfucking catchy and the catchiness has only been dialed up to the max. The drums also feel like they’re being played more enthusiastically and less like someone who sounds like they’re falling asleep. The subtle increase of fills and cymbals leaves a much stronger underlying foundation to each track. Another issue I feel has been adequately improved is the speed and more specifically, the blast beats. This album exhibits much more frequent and speedier blast beats giving which gave me the perfect outlet for my rage. I had my fingers crossed for improvements and I could not be more satisfied.</p>
<p>Frozen Soul played around with some creative elements throughout Glacial Domination, most notably, the use of a synthesiser during the intro of a few tracks and on the interval track ‘Annihilation’. I have mixed feelings on the synthesiser use. On one hand, it gives an unexpected sound and really exemplifies the chilly winter atmosphere. On the other hand it just feels… forced. ‘Annihilation’ really feels like nothing more then thirty seconds of filler which I could do without, especially considering it comes right before one of my favourite tracks, title track ‘Glacial Domination’. In contrast, the synth was used effectively to introduce the album on ‘Invisible Tormentor’ and for this I have to applaud Frozen Soul. Guest musician Gost (featured on several tracks) has made an undeniable contribution with the synth which at the least, I can respect. This brings me to one of the aspects that stuck out the most to me - the guest appearances. By far my favourite was John Gallagher’s tight snarls on the track ‘Morbid Effigy’. It contrasted well with Chad Green’s raspier style of growls and never makes for a boring listen. I don’t have too much to say for Matt Heafy’s appearance having never been a huge Trivium fan but hey, maybe it might draw in the Trivium fans to the darker and more icy side of metal. And as briefly mentioned before, the synth work of Gost on its own is stunning, I just feel its placement throughout the album at times feels a bit forced.</p>
<p>Glacial Domination could have been perhaps just a track or two shorter but rounding off at forty two minutes, I can’t complain. Frozen Soul brandish their menacing ice-cold songwriting once again and if you’re not a cold-blooded fan after Glacial Domination, I don’t know what would convince you. I’m glad to see less Bolt Thrower worship and more of Frozen Soul’s own freezing style on Glacial Domination which I will undoubtedly continue to listen to on repeat.</p>

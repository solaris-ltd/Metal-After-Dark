				Coming</a></h3>

		<p class="text-base">As a fan of death metal, I was curious as to what this "death 'n' roll" subgenre was, and I
			stumbled upon this
			album. At first, the album seems promising enough - the opening track certainly had my blood pumping. However, as
			the album progressed, it seemed to get more and more repetitive. Certainly, the rock 'n' roll theme itself was
			exciting, as I love a good rock anthem. It seemed though by constantly reinforcing the badassery of rock 'n' roll,
			the album tries to distract you from its biggest flaw: Repetitiveness.</p>

		<p class="text-base">As I mentioned, the first few tracks off the album were solid, with some catchy riffs and fast,
			almost punk-style
			drumming. The vocals were a good balance between the realm of death metal, while still being heavy enough to put
			the
			death in death 'n' roll. The solos were equally exciting, but the lack of transitioning from chorus to solo, then
			back again made it seem like a poor substitute for a compelling bridge that would have given each track something
			unique and distracted me from the formula that soon became evident for each song. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the
			extra
			instruments that you typically wouldn't expect that did give this album some flavour. Hearing a synthesiser making
			an appearance on a few tracks was certainly a treat. 'Mr. Cooger' was undeniably the high point of this album, the
			perfect song for this season of spooks. It left me beyond satisfied with its lyrical horrors ("Late at night and
			you're safe and sound/Meet Mr. Cooger as he haunts the ground/Tyrant's sleep where no demons go/Here goes Mr.
			Cooger
			to come reap and sow") paired with the fast pace and background choir vocals. Listening to this, I could certainly
			imagine fleeing from Mr. Cooger on a dark street on Halloween. The next track 'Ghouls and Goblins' again is a more
			goth-rock style, but still has a solid death 'n' roll backbone. I really would have loved to hear more of these
			melodic/goth elements throughout the rest of the album, but sadly Helltrain decide to stay rooted in a
			conventional
			rock- I mean death 'n' roll style.</p>

		<p class="text-base">The rest of the album, for the most part, does not offer anything stand-outish, aside from the
			solos (not just
			limited to guitar!). I would have probably been hitting my head against a wall if it weren't for the diversity of
			instruments making an appearance for the short and sweet solos ranging from bass to piano. (And a drum fill long
			enough to be its own short solo). Having said that, I did mention earlier the solos seem like a bad substitute for
			a
			bridge which I believe would have made each track more memorable as an individual. The chord progressions are
			simple
			and become mundane, which unfortunately reflects onto this album as a whole because riffs are pretty damn
			important.
		</p>

		<p class="text-base">For the most part, this album is still exciting enough - hearing unconventional instruments
			like a piano or synth
			is something refreshing that when done right, creates a kickass metal song. The solos on their own are crafted
			well,
			however, they do seem forced. But there are some quick bass solos thrown in, and I love a good bass solo.
			Regardless, I would've liked to hear some variety throughout this album though. Much like AC/DC, the riffs are
			essentially the same but they have the hard rock energy that will keep you engaged for just long enough. This
			album
			is by no means terrible - I still enjoyed listening to it. It's worth your forty minutes if you enjoy the rock 'n'
			roll get pumped-type energy with some spice thrown in.

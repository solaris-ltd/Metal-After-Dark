				Tritonus Bell</a></h3>

		<p class="text-base">Seeing the terrifyingly ghastly album cover for Hooded Menace’s latest album intrigued me
			immediately and I was
			without a doubt not disappointed by the contents. The Finnish death-doom titans perfectly intertwine the death to
			the doom without being some half-assed death metal band trying to play slow. At some points, delving into the
			realm
			of melodic death added another spanner into the works of this pure horror movie track album which I for one quite
			enjoyed. The album took me on twists and turns through its subtle change of tempo creating a terrifying
			unpredictable atmosphere all while the tritonus bell tolled. Gritty guitars and bass and pounding drums expertly
			write the recipe for death-doom perfection. Clocking out at a signature Hooded Menace 8-track, 50-minute album, it
			was well worth the listen.</p>
		<p class="text-base">I know album art isn’t an important factor for some metalheads, but I for one was drawn in by
			this cover like the
			pied piper. Hooded pied piper perhaps? The creativity behind the design that so effectively captures an intangible
			atmosphere is well worth a quick mention. This art alone deserves a photo frame above my CD player.</p>
		<p class="text-base">As for the music itself, the subtlety of weaving in and out of tempos while maintaining a
			constant atmosphere has
			to be my favorite technique employed throughout the album. It is done to an exceptional standard and solidifies
			what
			the death-doom genre should be. With just one fill from the almighty drums, the band will slow down as the guitars
			come in to create a beautiful melodic atmosphere before the band may turn around and mortify the atmosphere once
			again. Songs including “Blood Ornaments”, “Those Who Absorb The Night” make the album’s length well worth the
			experience because of this unpredictability. The melodic harmonies pair exceptionally with the slower parts of the
			album, flawlessly creating a more ominous tone to unite with the creeping rhythms.</p>
		<p class="text-base">Of course, when Hooded Menace turn the dial up on the tempo, the intensity creates an exciting
			listening
			experience. The bass is a constant, chugging, gritty steamroller that blends beautifully with the
			creatively-written
			guitar riffs that are more than headbang-worthy. This nightmarish combination builds the sinister atmosphere
			promised by the album cover, which I again reference because it is one of the most creative album covers I’ve
			seen,
			at least in my opinion. The drumming solidly provides a foundation for this atmosphere without being too excessive
			while still remaining interesting with some solid fills and tempo changes. Given the reliability on cymbals for
			the
			slower parts of the album, the drummer avoids becoming redundant, keeping it engaging from track to track.</p>
		<p class="text-base">The deep bellowing growls of Hooded Menace are, at least for me, the most impressive
			performance across this
			album.
			The slow and mighty cries are truly frightful. I love a good vocal performance, but to say these were impressive
			is
			an understatement. I can imagine the bell-toller on the album cover to be the one singing in this deathly tone.
			They
			serve their role well in creating the dread of The Tritonus Bell, and as does everything else, they never over nor
			underperform.
		</p>
		<p class="text-base">The Tritonus Bell was for me a fantastic proper introduction to death-doom, having not explored
			the genre much
			prior to listening to it and after delving into more death-doom, Hooded Menace still remains a top-tier band for
			me.
			The album is superbly crafted together and has an eager competing spot for my album of the year. The variety
			builds
			an unpredictable atmosphere of death and terror that will certainly keep you engaged if for whatever reason you
			haven’t listened to this album yet. The Tritonus Bell itself is in fact pure terror in musical form, unnoticeably
			alternating between fast and slow tempos with hypnotizing melodies that are sure to leave your death and doom fits
			of hunger satiated with each listen.</p>

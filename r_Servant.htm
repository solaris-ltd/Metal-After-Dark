<h1><i>Modern black metal landmark - 100%</i></h1>
<h3><b><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6ZSD4WIKMj5TigJKncs3Li?si=cd41cfbacd8d4acb">Servant - Blessed by the Light of a Thousand Stars</b></a></h3>
<p>Servant debuted in 2021 with this spectacular album, “Blessed by the Light of a Thousand Stars”. A true landmark of modern black metal this album offered so much across its nine tracks and no matter if you enjoy black metal or not, this is the album I would recommend to anyone. Though elitists would disagree, I much prefer the clean production of modern black metal to the shitty microphone shoved under the floor of an old shed of older black metal and this album is a perfect example. The production has increased the quality of every note and scream and made for a far more enjoyable listen. For a band from Germany, they sound every bit as Scandinavian as some of the most hailed black metal bands in history.
</p>
<p>To be blunt, the cover art is my only real complaint. It’s an uninteresting visual and having the band’s logo in brown against a black and white cover just doesn’t work. Suffice it to say, it doesn’t affect me too much and I’m only nitpicking at it because the music itself is just so damn good.</p>
<p>I do love the production quality on this album which I think is an aspect often overlooked when listening to a new record. It’s important for me, however, because it can be the make or break of listening enjoyment. On Blessed by the Light of a Thousand Stars, every instrument sounds perfectly clean and crisp and the vocals are surprisingly clear and I was able to make out several lines in every song. They are still, of course, evil and menacing but it was so much easier to get into the record when the sound was sifted pleasantly into my ear and I wasn’t straining my head just to pick out one note. Hearing what a band is actually saying gives me more appreciation for the ideas and representations in each song thereby giving it higher artistic value in my eyes.</p>
<p>I liked some of the acoustic moments too such as the album intro on ‘Negate the I’ and the interval track ‘Foreshadowing Rite’. It wasn’t overdone and the guitars were played with sophistication and advanced technique. These moments helped to strategically break up the album and maintain interest. In terms of overall instrumentation, I loved the vocals. The iconic snarling found across any black metal album is performed to peak throughout the record and kept my blood pumping the whole time. A vocal technique I absolutely begged for more of was the times when the singer would go into this almost clean but still very blackened scream. This is first employed a minor amount on Negate the I, but is used far more critically on my personal favourite track, ‘Ecclesia Obscuri’. The technique was done well and it was obvious the singer knew what he was doing. The next album to listen to on my list is Servant’s latest, “Aetas Ascensus” and I have my fingers crossed the vocals use this cleaner tone on more tracks there. I’m glad Servant did include a longer track on the album and I’m glad it was Ecclesia Obscuri. From the slow intro to the riffing, to some melodic background instruments and the aforementioned vocals, this track offers so much in its extended six minutes.</p>
<p>Servant has shown us the right way to do modern black metal on Blessed by the Light of a Thousand Stars. I will continue to come back to this album time and time again as I delve deeper into the black metal world. A truly underrated gem there’s just as much to enjoy on the album for the elite black metal purist as there is for the young black metal fan wearing heavy eyeliner and calling it corpse paint.</p>

		<p class="text-base">Welcome to the demo version of Metal After
			Dark! This is version alpha of my review website. You've no doubt seen the homepage and hopefully navigated around
			a
			little bit. This is something I've been wanting to do for quite awhile and I'm so happy it's finally official!
			There's nothing I can't say here that isn't mentioned elsewhere on the site so without further ado, please have a
			look around, read the reviews and send me some feedback! Thanks!</p>
